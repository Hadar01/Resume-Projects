# Quantum Computing Experiments & Notes

This directory contains my hands-on quantum computing experiments,
focused on understanding **quantum algorithms, circuits, and their limitations**
from a research perspective.

The work here emphasizes:
- algorithmic understanding
- experimental behavior
- comparison with theory
- reproducibility

## Topics Covered
- Qubits, measurement, and basic gates
- Quantum circuits and entanglement
- Core algorithms (e.g., Grover, QFT-style constructions)
- Noise, depth, and practical constraints

## Structure
- Each notebook/script focuses on **one concept or algorithm**
- Experiments include explanations, observations, and conclusions
- This folder is actively being refined into a research-style lab notebook

## Tools
- Python
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Jupyter

## Notes
These are not tutorials — they are **experiments and study artifacts**
intended to deepen understanding and prepare for research work
in AI, ML, and Quantum Computing.
